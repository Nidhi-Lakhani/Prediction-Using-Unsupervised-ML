# Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML

Here, we have to predict the optimum number of clusters of the given Iris dataset. It is prediction using unsupervised machine learning and we do this by KMeans Clustering and elbow method. The elbow is where the optimum number of clusters occur. The code is written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn.

This is a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation: Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) in the Data Science and Business Analytics domain.
